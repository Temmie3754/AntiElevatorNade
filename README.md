 An SCP:SL EXILED plugin to disable friendly fire elevator grenades
 
 Stops players from mass TKing by throwing grenades into elevators to wipe out the whole team without requiring friendly fire to be disabled.
 This only disables damage if all affected by the explosion and the thrower are of the same team.
 
 It contains an option for the thrower to take damage from their own grenade which can be changed in the config.
